# &nbsp; Price Part Picker <sub><sup><sub><sup><i>(need a better name and icon)</i></sup></sub></sup></sub>

A web Extension to show [kakaku.com](kakaku.com) prices on [PCPartPicker](pcpartpicker.com). Currently only on the 'Saved Parts Lists' page and 'Choose Your Parts' page.

*This project was initially created using the [react-typescript-web-extension-starter](https://github.com/aeksco/react-typescript-web-extension-starter) template.*

---

## Features

- Search and link a PCPartPicker part to a kakaku.com product.
- You can also link a particular search query instead of an explicit item. The first item of the search result is used to display the price.
- Hide PCPartPicker's price column.
- Dark mode is in sync with the PCPartPicker's dark mode.

**Not completed**
- Japanese localization (help needed)

**Notes**
-   Includes ESLint configured to work with TypeScript and Prettier.

-   Includes tests with Jest - note that the `babel.config.js` and associated dependencies are only necessary for Jest to work with TypeScript.

-   Recommended to use `Visual Studio Code` with the `Format on Save` setting turned on.

-   Icons courtesy of [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).

-   Includes Storybook configured to work with React + TypeScript. Note that it maintains its own `webpack.config.js` and `tsconfig.json` files. See example story in `src/components/hello/__tests__/hello.stories.tsx`

-   Includes a custom mock for the [webextension-polyfill-ts](https://github.com/Lusito/webextension-polyfill-ts) package in `src/__mocks__`. This allows you to mock any browser APIs used by your extension so you can develop your components inside Storybook.
